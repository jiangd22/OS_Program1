CS 5343 Operating System Program 1
    *
    * This program scheduler several different process scheduling algorithms
    * It reads a list of processes from a text file and simulates the behavior
    * of the following scheduling algorithms: FCFS, SJF, Priority, RR, and Priority-RR.
    *
    * 1.
    * To operate the program, the user must provide the name of the text file containing, the list of processes,
    * and the time quantum for the Round Robin algorithm.
    * To change name of the text file, the user must change line 150 in the main.cpp file.
    * (Hint: You can use the absolute path of the text file. Example: "C:\\Users\\User\\Desktop\\processes.txt")
    * To change the time quantum for the Round Robin algorithm, the user must change line 151 in the main.cpp file.
    * (Hint: The time quantum must be an integer greater than 0)
    * The user must compile the program using the following command: g++ -o main main.cpp or clang++ -o main main.cpp
    * The user must run the program using the following command: ./main
    *
    * 2.
    * The program will output the following information for FCFS, SJF, and Priority scheduling algorithm:
    * Column 0. The order in which the processes are executed (Task ID)
    * Column 1. The turnaround time for each process (Turnaround Time)
    * Column 2. The final time of the last process (Final Time)
    *
    * The program will output the following information for RR and Priority-RR scheduling algorithm:
    * Column 0. The order in which the processes are executed (Task ID)
    * Column 1. Current time of the process (Current Time)
    * Column 2. The time when the process exit the CPU. "*" indicates when the process is completed (Exit Time)
